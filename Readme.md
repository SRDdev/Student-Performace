## Overview
This project focuses on using TensorFlow Decision Forest, a machine learning framework, to predict student performance during game-based learning. The dataset used for training the model is one of the largest open datasets of game logs, providing a wealth of information to train and test the model's performance.

## Setup
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predict-student-performance.git
```


2. Install the necessary dependencies. This project requires [TensorFlow Decision Forest](https://www.tensorflow.org/decision_forests), which can be installed using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow_decision_forests
```


3. Download the dataset from the provided source and place it in the appropriate directory in the project repository.

## Usage
To use the model for predicting student performance, follow these steps:

1. Load the dataset into the model using the provided data preprocessing functions.
2. Train the model using the training data.
3. Evaluate the model's performance on the test data using appropriate metrics.
4. Use the trained model to predict student performance in real-time during game-based learning.
